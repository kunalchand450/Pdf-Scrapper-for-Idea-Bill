This task divides into 2 parts 
1. To extract unstructured data from pdf 
2. Extract tables from pdf.

For this, I used a pdf plumber for extracting text data and a tabula for table data.

After extraction, the data is not that pleasant 
So use the regex function to first clean the text data and prepare for further processing. 

After extraction and preprocessing, data gives us 
1. Name
2. Address
3. Invoice No
4. Mobile No.

Now the Extracted table from the tabula is not up to the mark.
Using various classes and functions to make it looks better two tables are combined with each other and the tabula takes it in a single row.
Apply several table operations to make them separate from each other with the help of the regex function.
Clean the nan values 
And appends the data 1 by 1 for making this program run.
Testing on multiple files performs well.


Pdf plumber and tabula help in the basic approach.
And python function makes this program runnable.
